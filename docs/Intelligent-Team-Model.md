## AI Agent Roles and Usage Guidelines

### 1. Documentation Agent

**Purpose**: Generate evidence-based system documentation

**Inputs**:
- Source code repository
- Existing documentation
- Git commit history

**Outputs**:
- High-Level Design (HLD.md)
- Low-Level Design (LLD.md)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Runbooks
- Status reports

**Invocation Pattern**:
```
Delivery Lead: "Documentation Agent, analyze the codebase and produce 
                an HLD covering system architecture, domain boundaries, 
                and deployment topology. Base all findings on actual code."
```

**Quality Control**:
- Delivery Lead reviews for accuracy
- Developers validate technical details
- Cross-reference with Migration-Plan.md for consistency

**Limitations**:
- Cannot infer business intent (only code structure)
- May miss undocumented architectural decisions
- Requires human validation of assumptions

---

### 2. Modernisation Agent

**Purpose**: Propose target architecture and migration strategies

**Inputs**:
- HLD and LLD from Documentation Agent
- Business constraints (timeline, budget, risk tolerance)
- Industry best practices (strangler fig, saga pattern, etc.)

**Outputs**:
- Target-Architecture.md
- Migration-Plan.md (technical tasks)
- Technology stack recommendations
- Risk assessments

**Invocation Pattern**:
```
Delivery Lead: "Modernisation Agent, design a target microservices 
                architecture for the Retail Monolith. Use strangler fig 
                pattern, prioritize low-risk extractions first, maintain 
                shared database through Phase 3."
```

**Quality Control**:
- Technical Lead reviews architectural soundness
- Team validates feasibility (can we actually build this?)
- Executive Sponsor reviews risk profile

**Limitations**:
- Cannot assess team capability constraints
- May propose overly complex solutions
- Requires human judgment on risk/reward trade-offs

---

### 3. Testing Agent

**Purpose**: Establish comprehensive test coverage

**Inputs**:
- HLD and LLD (system understanding)
- Existing codebase (to test against)
- Test strategy guidelines (Test-Strategy.md template)

**Outputs**:
- Test-Strategy.md
- xUnit test projects (unit, integration, E2E)
- CI/CD workflow configurations (GitHub Actions)
- Test data builders and fixtures

**Invocation Pattern**:
```
Delivery Lead: "Testing Agent, create integration tests for CartService 
                that validate add-to-cart, duplicate SKU handling, and 
                cart retrieval. Use in-memory database for isolation."
```

**Quality Control**:
- Developers review test correctness (does it test the right thing?)
- Tests must pass against existing monolith (baseline)
- Code coverage validated (minimum 80% for service layer)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot determine business-critical vs. edge cases
- May generate brittle tests (over-specified assertions)
- Requires human review for test maintainability

---

### 4. Implementation Agent

**Purpose**: Generate service extraction code and infrastructure

**Inputs**:
- Service specification (from Migration-Plan.md)
- Coding standards and patterns
- Existing monolith code (for reference)

**Outputs**:
- Service project structure (ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs)
- Entity Framework Core DbContext and entities
- API endpoint implementations
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Kubernetes manifests

**Invocation Pattern**:
```
Developer: "Implementation Agent, create Order Service with Minimal APIs. 
            Extract Order and OrderLine entities from monolith. Implement 
            GET /api/orders and GET /api/orders/{id} endpoints. Use shared 
            database connection string."
```

**Quality Control**:
- Developer reviews generated code for correctness
- Code Review Agent pre-screens for issues
- Delivery Lead approves pull request
- Automated tests validate functionality

**Limitations**:
- May generate boilerplate with subtle bugs
- Cannot understand complex business logic without detailed prompts
- Requires clear, detailed specifications to avoid errors

---

### 5. Code Review Agent

**Purpose**: Automated code review before human review

**Inputs**:
- Pull request diff
- Codebase context (existing code)
- Code quality rules and security patterns

**Outputs**:
- Code review comments (style, bugs, security)
- Severity ratings (critical, high, medium, low)
- Suggestions for improvements

**Invocation Pattern**:
```
Delivery Lead: "Code Review Agent, review PR #42 (Order Service extraction). 
                Check for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and 
                architectural consistency with approved patterns."
```

**Quality Control**:
- Human reviewer decides which comments to address
- False positives are common (AI may flag valid patterns)
- Critical issues always validated by human

**Limitations**:
- Cannot understand business context
- May flag valid design decisions as issues
- Cannot assess whether code solves the right problem

## AI Augmentation Productivity Assumptions

### Expected AI Contributions by Activity

| Activity | AI Contribution | Human Contribution | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Service boilerplate** | 80% | 20% | AI excels at repetitive structure (DbContext, models, API endpoints) |
| **Business logic** | 30% | 70% | Requires domain understanding and edge case handling |
| **Test generation** | 60% | 40% | AI generates test structure, humans validate correctness |
| **Infrastructure code** | 70% | 30% | AI generates Dockerfile, K8s manifests; humans review security |
| **Documentation** | 90% | 10% | AI generates from code; humans review for accuracy |
| **Code review** | 40% | 60% | AI pre-screens, humans make final judgment |

### Productivity Multiplier Estimates

- **Without AI**: 2-3 developers @ 100% capacity
- **With AI**: 2-3 developers @ 150-180% effective capacity
- **DevOps with AI**: 1 engineer @ 130-150% effective capacity

**Assumptions**:
- AI reduces boilerplate coding time by 60%
- Humans spend 20% of time reviewing and correcting AI outputs
- Learning curve for AI usage: 1-2 weeks (already accounted in Phase 0-1)

---

## Risk Mitigation for AI Augmentation

### Risk: AI Generates Incorrect Code

**Likelihood**: High (AI will make mistakes)  
**Impact**: Medium (caught in code review and testing)

**Mitigation**:
- Mandatory human code review for all AI-generated code
- Comprehensive automated test suite (21+ tests)
- Code Review Agent pre-screens before human review
- Delivery Lead reviews critical architectural components

**Control**: Pull request approval required before merge

---

### Risk: Team Over-Relies on AI, Skills Atrophy

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: High (team cannot maintain system without AI)

**Mitigation**:
- Developers must understand all code they approve
- Regular code review sessions to discuss AI outputs
- Learning objectives for each phase (e.g., saga pattern in Phase 3)
- Developers encouraged to modify AI code, not just accept

**Control**: Capability assessment after Phase 2 (can team deliver independently?)

---

### Risk: AI Augmentation Slows Delivery (Learning Curve)

**Likelihood**: Low (mitigated by Phase 0 learning)  
**Impact**: Medium (timeline slippage)

**Mitigation**:
- Phase 0 includes AI tool training
- Simple tasks assigned first (documentation, boilerplate)
- Delivery Lead available for prompt engineering guidance
- Fallback to manual approach if AI consistently fails

**Control**: Track AI usage and productivity in weekly retrospectives

---
